                Although I thought Wasserstein GANs should have been better I was not able to successfully train a
                model. My results were nothing but noise, even to the end. I believe I trained it for 1200 epochs if not
                more. The attempt can be seen <a href="https://github.com/RaymondDashWu/Pokemon-GAN">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that the ultimate reason neither of these models generated realistic Pokemon is that each
                Pokemon is incredibly stylized. Unlike a face, horse, or other object that has been generated there is
                no consistency. Each Pokemon may or may not have arms, legs. Some are based off of objects such as an
                ice cream cone, a boulder, or a tree. There isn't any defining feature that makes a Pokemon a Pokemon.
                It seems to be more of an art style once you know what several Pokemon look like. At this moment I'm not
                aware of a better generative model that would produce better results. However, I believe that the Style
                GAN did better because it attempted to find those high level attributes and merge them together.
                Certainly not the most believable Pokemon to someone that has closely followed the series but I think it
                might fool a person or two who haven't kept up or only know of the series through proxy!
